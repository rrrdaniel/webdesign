/* This bit of CSS is a really common way to replace a piece of text with an image. The example here is for a link, 
but you could use it for any content you wanted to replace with an image. Doing it this way keeps your html code
"semantic" aka meaningful (the link says what it is as opposed to being just an image) and allows for flexibility. */

.linkclass a {
  /* Set a width and height for your "button" */
  width: 300px; /* Set to the right width for your button */
	height: 100px; /* Set to the right height for your button */

/*	Set your background image + any other background properties such as repeating, etc. */
	background-image: url(path/to/image.jpg);

/*	Push your text wayyyyy out of its box. Since overflowed content is hidden, that hides the text. */
